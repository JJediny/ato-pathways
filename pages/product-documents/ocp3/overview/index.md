OpenShift Container Platform 3.x Overview

## Common Criteria
OpenShift Container Platform 3.x has not undergone Common Criteria certification. A future certification
against the [NIAP Protection Profile for Application Software](https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=394&id=394) is being considered.

To help Red Hat track demand for a Common Criteria certification of OpenShift Container Platform 3.x, please open a
customer support case requesting an evaluation.

## FIPS 140-2
Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 is a legal requirement ensuring cryptographic tools implement algorithms properly. Vendors must certify their cryptographic implementations through NIST's [Cryptographic Module Validation Program](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program).

FIPS 140-2 validation does not constitute an entire product. Rather, underlying cryptographic
subsystems or components, such as OpenSSL and OpenSSH, are validated. 

When OpenShift Container Platform 3.x runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x, the following FIPS 140-2 validations
are retained:

| Product | Component | Version | NIST Certificate | Status | Sunset/Expiration? |
|:--------|:----------|:-------:|:----------------:|:------:|:------------------:|
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x | OpenSSL | 5.0 | [#3016](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Certificate/3016) | <span class="usa-label-big">ACTIVE</span> | 9/14/2022 |

#### Known Issues with FIPS 140-2 Enablement
- By default OpenShift utilizes self-signed certificates. These certificates
are generated by Golang cryptographic API calls and do not meet FIPS 140-2
requirements. It is recommended to use external certificates from
an organizationally recognized Certificate Authority as mitigation.
- By default OpenShift APIs utilize Golang TLS which has not undergone
FIPS 140-2 evaluations. To mitigate this, consider using Opportunistic IPSec
which encapsulates all traffic in OpenSSL tunnels (meeting the requirement for
encryption in transit).

## USGv6 / IPv6
OpenShift Container Platform 3.x does not have any US Government IPv6 certifications.

## Section 508 / VPAT
Coming soon.

## Configuration Guides
A NIST National Checklist for OpenShift Container Platform 3.x is currently being developed. Contact your Red Hat
representative for pre-release access!

## Risk Register
To assist with risk management decisions, a listing of known OpenShift limitations against NIST 800-53 rev4 controls is provided below. Limitations are categorized as high/medium/low severity in alignment with DISA's Vulnerability Severity Category Code Definitions:

|                 | DISA Category Code Guidelines |
|:---------------:|:------------------------------|
| HIGH (CAT I) | Any vulnerability, the exploitation of which will directly and immediately result in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity.|
| MEDIUM (CAT II) | Any vulnerability, the exploitation of which has a potential to result in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity.|
| LOW (CAT III) | Any vulnerability, the existence of which degrades measures to protect against loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity.|

The following are known limitations of OpenShift 3.x's ability to meet NIST 800-53 rev4 technical controls:

| NIST 800-53 Control | Risk Determination | Description/Rationale |
|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:---------------------------|
| AC-7(b) | LOW | AC-7(b) requires that, upon exceeding consecutive failed logon attempt limits, the information system delays the next logon prompt by a selected amount of time. This capability is not present in OpenShift 3.x nor is it planned. If this capability is meaningful for your deployment, please open a feature request through your Red Hat account team.|
